# Covid-19 Tracker App (REACT)

This Project is a beginner friendly project I built using React. Some key Aspects are:

- Shows live Cases, Recoveries, Deaths (clickable tabs)
- Shows Worldwide cases and Country Based cases
- Shows a table sorting all the countries from more cases to less.
- Line Chart shows new cases daily data. Hover around to see exact figures (It shows data from the past 120 days)
- Clickable Markers on Map showing all the countries and their respective stats

# What was used to develop this project

For this project I used:

- React.js, as the main framework.
- Material UI, for designing.
- Chart.js, to display the linear chart.
- Leaflet.js, to display the world map.
- Numeral.js, to sort and display the numbers.
- Used the disease.sh free COVID-19 API to retrieve all the data.
